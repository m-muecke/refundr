\description{
Fractional anisotropy (FA) tract profiles for the corpus callosum (cca) and
the right corticospinal tract (rcst). Accompanying the tract profiles are
the subject ID numbers, visit number, total number of scans, multiple
sclerosis case status and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (pasat)
score.

\details{
If you use this data as an example in written work, please include the
following acknowledgment: ``The MRI/DTI data were collected at Johns
Hopkins University and the Kennedy-Krieger Institute"

DTI2 uses mean diffusivity of the the corpus callosum rather than FA, and
parallel diffusivity of the rcst rather than FA. Please see the
documentation for DTI2.
